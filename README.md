## Description

[Cephalon Tobran][cephalon-tobran-org] is dedicated to aiding players of the free-to-play game [Warframe][warframe-referral] find, collect and track the numerous frames, weapons, mods, and other collectibles available in-game.

Disclaimer: the above link is a referral link. I'm not paid, but we both benefit with in-game stuff from using it, if you don't already have an account.

This is the portion that controls the backend data.

I started this project to grow and test my development skills. It's meant for my amusement, for now.
